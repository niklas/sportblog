Welcome to rSpec


Preparation
  * it is a testing framework, so it runs in the :test environment
  * set up a db for it (everything will be deleted in every test run)
  * install gems: rspec, ZenTest
  * script/generate rspec (just one time)
  * install plugins: rspec, rspec-rails

Daily Work
  * use rspec_* generators
  * write your tests first
  * run them
    * manually
    * autospec
    * specserver
